# Overview

## Accomplish Goals (What I learned)
I didn't learn much with this program, it's just a small program I've made many times. It was great practice, as my last class mostly used JetBrains, so I had to remember how to initalize a program in Visual Studio Code.

## Software Description
This simple program asks the user for their name, and then prints off a welcome message that includes the provided names

## Software Purpose
By itself, this program isn't anything special, but it could be a function that's part of a much longer application that records different users and their information.
